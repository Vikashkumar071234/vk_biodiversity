   <h1>HOTSPOTS OF BIODIVERSITY</h1>
</div>
<div class="hotspot">
    <p>A biodiversity hotspot is a biogeographic region with significant levels of biodiversity that is threatened by human habitation.</p>
    
    <p>Norman Myers wrote about the concept in two articles in The Environmentalist in 1988 and 1990, after which the concept was revised following thorough analysis by Myers and others into “Hotspots: Earth's Biologically Richest and Most Endangered Terrestrial Ecoregions” and a paper published in the journal Nature, both in 2000.</p>
    <p>To qualify as a biodiversity hotspot on Myers' 2000 edition of the hotspot map, a region must meet two strict criteria:</p>
    <br>
    <ul><li>
        The region should have at least 1500 species of vascular plants i.e., it should have a high degree of endemism.

    </li>
    <br>
<li>It must contain 30% (or less) of its original habitat, i.e. it must be threatened.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<p>
    Globally, 36 zones qualify under this definition. These sites support nearly 60% of the world's plant, bird, mammal, reptile, and amphibian species, with a high share of those species as endemics. Some of these hotspots support up to 15,000 endemic plant species, and some have lost up to 95% of their natural habitat.
</p>
<br>
<div id="twoi">
    
    <p>Biodiversity hotspots host their diverse ecosystems on just 2.4% of the planet's surface. Ten hotspots were originally identified by Myer; the current 36 used to cover more than 15.7% of all the land but have lost around 85% of their area. This loss of habitat is why approximately 60% of the world's terrestrial life lives on only 2.4% of the land surface area. Caribbean Islands like Haiti and Jamaica are facing serious pressures on the populations of endemic plants and vertebrates as a result of rapid deforestation. Other areas include the Tropical Andes, Philippines, Mesoamerica, and Sundaland, which, under the current levels at which deforestation is occurring, will likely lose most of their plant and vertebrate species.</p>

    <h3 style="color:chocolate">Hotspot conservation initiatives</h3>
    <p>Only a small percentage of the total land area within biodiversity hotspots is now protected. Several international organizations are working to conserve biodiversity hotspots.</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF) is a global program that provides funding and technical assistance to nongovernmental organizations in order to protect the Earth's richest regions of plant and animal diversity, including biodiversity hotspots, high-biodiversity wilderness areas and important marine regions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The World Wide Fund for Nature has devised a system called the "Global 200 Ecoregions", the aim of which is to select priority ecoregions for conservation from fourteen terrestrial, three freshwater, and four marine habitat types. They are chosen for species richness, endemism, taxonomic uniqueness, unusual ecological or evolutionary phenomena, and global rarity. All biodiversity hotspots contain at least one Global 200 Ecoregion.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Birdlife International has identified 218 “Endemic Bird Areas” (EBAs) each of which holds two or more bird species found nowhere else. Birdlife International has identified more than 11,000 Important Bird Areas[10] all over the world.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Plant life International coordinates programs aiming to identify and manage Important Plant Areas.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Alliance for Zero Extinction is an initiative of scientific organizations and conservation groups who co-operate to focus on the most threatened endemic species of the world. They have identified 595 sites, including many Birdlife's Important Bird Areas.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The National Geographic Society has prepared a world map of the hotspots and ArcView shapefile and metadata for the Biodiversity Hotspots including details of the individual endangered fauna in each hotspot, which is available from Conservation International.[</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The Compensatory Afforestation Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) seeks to control the destruction of forests in India.</p>

    Now Four of these hotspots lie in india extending into neighbouring countries namely, Indo-Burma region, Whole of Himalayas, Western Ghats-Srilanks region and Sunalands-Nicobar Group of Islands.
</p>
<p>The Indian hotspots are not only rich in floral wealth and endemic species of plants but also repltiles,amphibians, Swallow tailed butterflies and some Mammals.</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li style="color:crimson">INDO-BURMA HOT SPOT</li>
</ul>
<p>Indo-Burma encompasses 2,373,000 square kilometres (916,000 sq mi) of tropical Asia, east of the Ganges-Brahmaputra lowlands. Formerly including the Himalaya chain and the associated foothills in Nepal, Bhutan, and India, Indo-Burma has now been more narrowly redefined as the Indo-Chinese subregion. The area contains the Lower Mekong catchment. It begins in eastern Bangladesh and then extends across north-eastern India, south of the Brahmaputra River, to encompass nearly all of Myanmar, part of southern and western Yunnan Province in China, all of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Cambodia and Vietnam, the vast majority of Thailand and a small part of Peninsular Malaysia. In addition, the hotspot covers the coastal lowlands of southern China (in southern Guangxi and Guangdong), as well as several offshore islands, such as Hainan Island (of China) in the South China Sea and the Andaman Islands (of India) in the Andaman Sea. The hotspot contains the Lower Mekong catchment.</p>
<p>The hotspot encompasses 33 terrestrial ecoregions, which include tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests, tropical and subtropical coniferous forests, temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, and mangroves.</p>
<p>The transition to the Sundaland Hotspot in the south occurs on the Thai-Malay Peninsula, the boundary between the two hotspots is represented by the Kangar-Pattani Line, which cuts across the Thailand-Malaysia border, though some analyses indicate that the phytogeographical and zoogeographical transition between the Sundaland and Indo-Burma biotas may lie just to the north of the Isthmus of Kra, associated with a gradual change from wet seasonal evergreen dipterocarp rainforest to mixed moist deciduous forest.</p>
<p>Much of Indo-Burma is characterized by distinct seasonal weather patterns. During the northern winter months, dry, cool winds blow from the stable continental Asian high-pressure system, resulting in a dry period under clear skies across much of the south, center, and west of the hotspot (the dry, northeast monsoon). As the continental system weakens in spring, the wind direction reverses and air masses forming the southwest monsoon picks up moisture from the seas to the southwest and bring abundant rains as they rise over the hills and mountains.</p>
<div id="flex">
    <p>
        <br>
        A wide diversity of ecosystems is represented in this hotspot, including mixed wet evergreen, dry evergreen, deciduous, and montane forests. There are also patches of shrublands and woodlands on karst limestone outcrops and, in some coastal areas, scattered heath forests. In addition, a wide variety of distinctive, localized vegetation formations occur in Indo-Burma, including lowland floodplain swamps, mangroves, and seasonally inundated grasslands.
    </p>
    <div id="img">
        <img src="https://charlespaddockzoo.org/images/page-blocks/3/map-hotspot-indo-burma.png">
    </div>
</div>
<p>The area includes portions of eastern India (including the Andaman and Nicobar Islands), the eastern part of Bangladesh (Chittagong hill tracts), southernmost China, most of Myanmar (excluding the northern tip), most of Thailand (excluding the southern tip), and all of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Indo-Burma was one of the first places where humans developed agriculture, and has a history of using fire to clear land for agriculture and other needs. The need for agricultural products has increased in recent years, with the expansion of both human populations and markets. This has contributed to widespread forest destruction; tree plantations (teak, rubber, oil palm) have replaced large areas of lowland forest, while coffee, tea, vegetable crops and sugarcane plantations threaten montane and hill forests. Other threats to forests include logging, mining for gems and ore, firewood collection, and charcoal production.</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li style="color:crimson">WESTERN GHATS-SRI LANKA HOTSPOT</li>
</ul><br>
<p>
    The hotspot extends along a 17,000 km2 strip of forests in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Recentle, in july 2012, the western Ghats have been included in the world Heritage sites.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>It has 40% of the total endemic plant species.</li>
    <li>About 62% amphibians and 50% Lizards are endemic to Western Ghats.</li>
    <li>Forest tracts up to 500m elevation covering 20% of the foret expanse are evergreen while those in 500-1500 m range are semi-evergreen.</li>
    <li>The major centers of diversity are <b>Agastyamalai Hills</b> and <b> Silent Valley- the New Amambalam Reserve Basin</b>.</li>
    
</ul>
<p>
    It is reported that only 6.8% of the original forests are existing today while the rest has been deforested or degraded, which raises a serious cause of alarm, because it means we have already lost a huge proportion of the biodiversity.
</p>
</div>
<br>
<ul>
    <li style="color:crimson">HIMALAYAS HOTSPOT</li>
</ul>
<p>The hotspot displays an ultra-varied topography that forests rich species diversity and endemism.</p>
<p>The Himalaya hotspot, which stretches over 3,000 kilometers across northern Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, and the northwestern and northeastern states of India, contains all of the world's mountain peaks higher than 8,000 meters, including Mt. Everest (8,849 meters), as well as several of the world's deepest river gorges.</p>
<ul>
    <li>There are numerous deep and semi-isolated valleys in sikkim which are extremely rich in endemic plant species, particularly orchids.</li>
    <li>In an area of 7928 km2 of sikkim about 4260 plant species are found of which 60% are endemic.</li>
    </ul>
    <div id="himala">
        <div id="li"><ul><br>
    <li>The forest cover of Eastern Himalayas has dwindled to about 1/3rd of its original cover.</li>
    <li>Certain species like saparia himalayana, a parasitic angiosperm was sighted only twice in this region in the last 70 years.</li>
<li>This hotspot is an active center of organic evolution and is considered to be the cardle of flowering plants.</li>
<li>out of the World's recorded flora 30% are endemic to India of which 35,000 are in the Himalayas.</li>

        </ul><br>
        <p>The Sundaland hotspot lies in South-East Asia and covers Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Brunei, and Malaysia. In the year 2013, the Sundaland was declared as a World Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations. This region is famous for its rich terrestrial and marine ecosystem. Sundaland is one of the biologically richest hotspots in the world which comprises 25,000 species of vascular plants, of which 15,000 are found only in this region.</p>
